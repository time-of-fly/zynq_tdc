2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net hit0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): hit0_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net hit1_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): hit1_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/control/hitQ_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/control/hitQ_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/sync_2/ff_2 in site SLICE_X21Y21 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/AXI_control/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.INPUT_DOUBLE_REGS4/GENERATE_LEVEL_P_S_CDC.MULTI_BIT.FOR_IN_cdc_to[0].CROSS2_PLEVEL_IN2SCNDRY_IN_cdc_to is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#2 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/sync_3/ff_2 in site SLICE_X15Y14 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/AXI_control/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.INPUT_DOUBLE_REGS4/GENERATE_LEVEL_P_S_CDC.MULTI_BIT.FOR_IN_cdc_to[1].CROSS2_PLEVEL_IN2SCNDRY_IN_cdc_to is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#3 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/sync_2/ff_2 in site SLICE_X23Y24 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/AXI_control/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.INPUT_DOUBLE_REGS4/GENERATE_LEVEL_P_S_CDC.MULTI_BIT.FOR_IN_cdc_to[0].CROSS2_PLEVEL_IN2SCNDRY_IN_cdc_to is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#4 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDCE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/sync_3/ff_2 in site SLICE_X25Y20 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/AXI_control/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.INPUT_DOUBLE_REGS4/GENERATE_LEVEL_P_S_CDC.MULTI_BIT.FOR_IN_cdc_to[1].CROSS2_PLEVEL_IN2SCNDRY_IN_cdc_to is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock TDCsystem_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_0/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TDCsystem_i/AXITDC_1/U0/TDC/Delay_line/hitQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock TDCsystem_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin TDCsystem_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
